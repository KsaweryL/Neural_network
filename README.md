# Neural_network
A neural network that detects whether the review is positive or negative â€“ written in Python as part of an assignment, uses Tensorflow and Keras libraries to create layers and train the network.

For the assignment itself we were given the load_data() and preprocess_data() functions, alongside the keras-data file of pickle format, where the reviews are stored.
The train_model function was defined by me.
